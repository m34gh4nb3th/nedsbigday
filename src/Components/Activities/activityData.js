                        smoked cherries and bone marrow, buttermilk pancakes, and peanut butter captin' crunch.</p>

                            So when we moved to Seattle it was very important to find a good scone spot. Macrina has been the clear winner. If you're not 
                            as into scones as we are, try their morning buns, squash bread, or breakfast sandwiches.</p>
